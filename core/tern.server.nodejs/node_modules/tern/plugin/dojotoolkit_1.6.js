For datastores that mixin simpleFetch, simpleFetch\nimplements a fetch method that automatically handles eight of the fetch()\narguments -- onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onError, start, count, sort and scope\nThe class mixing in simpleFetch should not implement fetch(),\nbut should instead implement a _fetchItems() method.  The _fetchItems()\nmethod takes three arguments, the keywordArgs object that was passed\nto fetch(), a callback function to be called when the result array is\navailable, and an error callback to be called if something goes wrong.\nThe _fetchItems() method should ignore any keywordArgs parameters for\nstart, count, onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onError, sort, and scope.\nThe _fetchItems() method needs to correctly handle any other keywordArgs\nparameters, including the query parameter and any optional parameters\n(such as includeChildren).  The _fetchItems() method should create an array of\nresult items and pass it to the fetchHandler along with the original request object\n-- or, the _fetchItems() method may, if it wants to, create an new request object\nwith other specifics about the request that are specific to the datastore and pass\nthat as the request object to the handler.\n\nFor more information on this specific function, see dojo.data.api.Read.fetch()"}},"sorter":{"basicComparator":{"!type":"fn(a: +anything, b: +anything)","!doc":"Basic comparision function that compares if an item is greater or less than another item"},"createSortFunction":{"!type":"fn(sortSpec: +attributes, store: +dojo.data.core.Read) -> number","!doc":"Helper function to generate the sorting function based off the list of sort attributes."}}}},"fx":{"!doc":"Effects library on top of Base animations","chain":{"!type":"fn(animations: [+dojo.Animation]) -> +dojo.Animation","!doc":"Chain a list of dojo.Animation s to run in sequence"},"combine":{"!type":"fn(animations: [+dojo.Animation]) -> +dojo.Animation","!doc":"Combine an array of <code>dojo.Animation</code>s to run in parallel"},"wipeIn":{"!type":"fn(args: ?) -> +dojo.Animation","!doc":"Returns an animation that will expand the\nnode defined in 'args' object from it's current height to\nit's natural height (with no scrollbar).\nNode must have no margin/border/padding."},"wipeOut":{"!type":"fn(args: ?) -> +dojo.Animation","!doc":"Returns an animation that will shrink node defined in &quot;args&quot;\nfrom it's current height to 1px, and then hide it."},"slideTo":{"!type":"fn(args?: ?) -> +dojo.Animation","!doc":"Returns an animation that will slide &quot;node&quot;\ndefined in args Object from its current position to\nthe position defined by (args.left, args.top)."},"Toggler":{"!type":"fn()","prototype":{"!doc":"class constructor for an animation toggler.
