  "readme": "# Acorn\n\nA tiny, fast JavaScript parser, written completely in JavaScript.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe easiest way to install acorn is with [`npm`][npm].\n\n[npm]: http://npmjs.org\n\n```sh\nnpm install acorn\n```\n\nAlternately, download the source.\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/marijnh/acorn.git\n```\n\n## Components\n\nWhen run in a CommonJS (node.js) or AMD environment, exported values\nappear in the interfaces exposed by the individual files, as usual.\nWhen loaded in the browser without any kind of module management, a\nsingle global object `acorn` will be defined, and all the exported\nproperties will be added to that.\n\n### acorn.js\n\nThis file contains the actual parser (and is what you get when you\n`require(\"acorn\")` in node.js).\n\n**parse**`(input, options)` is used to parse a JavaScript program.\nThe `input` parameter is a string, `options` can be undefined or an\nobject setting some of the options listed below. The return value will\nbe an abstract syntax tree object as specified by the\n[Mozilla Parser API][mozapi].\n\nWhen  encountering   a  syntax   error,  the   parser  will   raise  a\n`SyntaxError` object with a meaningful  message. The error object will\nhave a `pos` property that indicates the character offset at which the\nerror occurred,  and a `loc`  object that contains a  `{line, column}`\nobject referring to that same position.\n\n[mozapi]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API\n\n- **ecmaVersion**: Indicates the ECMAScript version to parse. Must be\n  either 3 or 5. This influences support for strict mode, the set of\n  reserved words, and support for getters and setter. Default is 5.\n\n- **strictSemicolons**: If `true`, prevents the parser from doing\n  automatic semicolon insertion, and statements that do not end with\n  a semicolon will generate an error. Defaults to `false`.\n\n- **allowTrailingCommas**: If `false`, the parser will not allow\n  trailing commas in array and object literals. Default is `true`.\n\n- **forbidReserved**: If `true`, using a reserved word will generate\n  an error. Defaults to `false`. When given the value `\"everywhere\"`,\n  reserved words and keywords can also not be used as property names\n  (as in Internet Explorer's old parser).\n  \n- **allowReturnOutsideFunction**: By default, a return statement at\n  the top level raises an error. Set this to `true` to accept such\n  code.\n\n- **locations**: When `true`, each node has a `loc` object attached\n  with `start` and `end` subobjects, each of which contains the\n  one-based line and zero-based column numbers in `{line, column}`\n  form. Default is `false`.\n\n- **onComment**: If a function is passed for this option, whenever a\n  comment is encountered the function will be called with the\n  following parameters:\n\n  - `block`: `true` if the comment is a block comment, false if it\n    is a line comment.\n  - `text`: The content of the comment.\n  - `start`: Character offset of the start of the comment.\n  - `end`: Character offset of the end of the comment.\n\n  When the `locations` options is on, the `{line, column}` locations\n  of the comment’s start and end are passed as two additional\n  parameters.\n\n  Note that you are not allowed to call the parser from the\n  callback—that will corrupt its internal state.\n\n- **ranges**: Nodes have their start and end characters offsets\n  recorded in `start` and `end` properties (directly on the node,\n  rather than the `loc` object, which holds line/column data. To also\n  add a [semi-standardized][range] \"range\" property holding a\n  `[start, end]` array with the same numbers, set the `ranges` option\n  to `true`.\n\n- **program**: It is possible to parse multiple files into a single\n  AST by passing the tree produced by parsing the first file as the\n  `program` option in subsequent parses. This will add the toplevel\n  forms of the parsed file to the \"Program\" (top) node of an existing\n  parse tree.\n\n- **sourceFile**: When the `locations` option is `true`, you can pass\n  this option to add a `sourceFile` attribute in every node’s `loc`\n  object. Note that the contents of this option are not examined or\n  processed in any way; you are free to use whatever format you\n  choose.\n\n- **directSourceFile**: Like `sourceFile`, but the property will be\n  added directly to the nodes, rather than to a `loc` object.\n\n[range]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=745678\n\n**getLineInfo**`(input, offset)` can be used to get a `{line,\ncolumn}` object for a given program string and character offset.\n\n**tokenize**`(input, options)` exports a primitive interface to\nAcorn's tokenizer. The function takes an input string and options\nsimilar to `parse` (though only some options are meaningful here), and\nreturns a function that can be called repeatedly to read a single\ntoken, and returns a `{start, end, type, value}` object (with added\n`startLoc` and `endLoc` properties when the `locations` option is\nenabled). This object will be reused (updated) for each token, so you\ncan't count on it staying stable.\n\n**tokTypes** holds an object mapping names to the token type objects\nthat end up in the `type` properties of tokens.\n\n### acorn_loose.js ###\n\nThis file implements an error-tolerant parser. It exposes a single\nfunction.\n\n**parse_dammit**`(input, options)` takes the same arguments and\nreturns the same syntax tree as the `parse` function in `acorn.js`,\nbut never raises an error, and will do its best to parse syntactically\ninvalid code in as meaningful a way as it can. It'll insert identifier\nnodes with name `\"✖\"` as placeholders in places where it can't make\nsense of the input. Depends on `acorn.js`, because it uses the same\ntokenizer.\n\n### util/walk.js ###\n\nImplements an abstract syntax tree walker. Will store its interface in\n`acorn.walk` when used without a module system.\n\n**simple**`(node, visitors, base, state)` does a 'simple' walk over\na tree. `node` should be the AST node to walk, and `visitors` an\nobject with properties whose names correspond to node types in the\n[Mozilla Parser API][mozapi]. The properties should contain functions\nthat will be called with the node object and, if applicable the state\nat that point. The last two arguments are optional. `base` is a walker\nalgorithm, and `state` is a start state. The default walker will\nsimply visit all statements and expressions and not produce a\nmeaningful state. (An example of a use of state it to track scope at\neach point in the tree.)\n\n**ancestor**`(node, visitors, base, state)` does a 'simple' walk over\na tree, building up an array of ancestor nodes (including the current node)\nand passing the array to callbacks in the `state` parameter.\n\n**recursive**`(node, state, functions, base)` does a 'recursive'\nwalk, where the walker functions are responsible for continuing the\nwalk on the child nodes of their target node. `state` is the start\nstate, and `functions` should contain an object that maps node types\nto walker functions. Such functions are called with `(node, state, c)`\narguments, and can cause the walk to continue on a sub-node by calling\nthe `c` argument on it with `(node, state)` arguments. The optional\n`base` argument provides the fallback walker functions for node types\nthat aren't handled in the `functions` object. If not given, the\ndefault walkers will be used.\n\n**make**`(functions, base)` builds a new walker object by using the\nwalker functions in `functions` and filling in the missing ones by\ntaking defaults from `base`.\n\n**findNodeAt**`(node, start, end, test, base, state)` tries to\nlocate a node in a tree at the given start and/or end offsets, which\nsatisfies the predicate `test`. `start` end `end` can be either `null`\n(as wildcard) or a number. `test` may be a string (indicating a node\ntype) or a function that takes `(nodeType, node)` arguments and\nreturns a boolean indicating whether this node is interesting. `base`\nand `state` are optional, and can be used to specify a custom walker.\nNodes are tested from inner to outer, so if two nodes match the\nboundaries, the inner one will be preferred.\n\n**findNodeAround**`(node, pos, test, base, state)` is a lot like\n`findNodeAt`, but will match any node that exists 'around' (spanning)\nthe given position.\n\n**findNodeAfter**`(node, pos, test, base, state)` is similar to\n`findNodeAround`, but will match all nodes *after* the given position\n(testing outer nodes before inner nodes).\n\n## Command line interface\n\nThe `bin/acorn` utility can be used to parse a file from the command\nline. It accepts as arguments its input file and the following\noptions:\n\n- `--ecma3|--ecma5`: Sets the ECMAScript version to parse. Default is\n  version 5.\n\n- `--strictSemicolons`: Prevents the parser from doing automatic\n  semicolon insertion. Statements that do not end in semicolons will\n  generate an error.\n\n- `--locations`: Attaches a \"loc\" object to each node with \"start\" and\n  \"end\" subobjects, each of which contains the one-based line and\n  zero-based column numbers in `{line, column}` form.\n\n- `--compact`: No whitespace is used in the AST output.\n\n- `--silent`: Do not output the AST, just return the exit status.\n\n- `--help`: Print the usage information and quit.\n\nThe utility spits out the syntax tree as JSON data.\n",
